    "# 1. How Java Compiles\n",
    "* Javac.exe compiles source file (.java) into byte code files (.class). Pass this file to JVM\n",
    "* There are three stages executed in JVM:\n",
    "    * Load main class \n",
    "    * Bytecode Verifier (initialize, type checking)\n",
    "    * Just-In-Time Compiler (JIT) translates code into machine code\n",
    "    \n",
    "# 2. OOP Concepts\n",
    "## 2.1 Definition\n",
    "In OOP languages, programmers define**not only the data type of a data structure, but also the types of operations (functions)** that can be applied to the data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2 Four Basic Concepts\n",
    "1. Encapsulation: **hiding of data implementation** by restricting access to public methods.\n",
    "2. Abstraction: using abstract class/interface to **express the intent of the class rather than the actual implementation**.\n",
    "3. Polymorphism: **\"One name many forms.\"** It is further of two types - static and dynamic. Static polymorphism is achieved using method overloading and dynamic polymorphism using method overriding\n",
    "4. Inheritance: **\"Inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class\"**. We can reuse the code of existing super classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Objects\n",
    "## 3.1 Storage of Objects\n",
    "1. Registers.\n",
    "2. The stack: references to objects and primitive types.\n",
    "3. The heap: Actual objects.\n",
    "4. Static Storage: in a fixed location\n",
    "5. Constants: Placed in the program code\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.2 Primitive Types\n",
    "8 primitive types (digits, chars, byte and boolean): byte、short、int、long、float、double、char、boolean. **No reference** is created for primitive types. **String** is not primitive. Java also have high-precision classes like BigInteger and BigDecimal\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.3 Array of Objects\n",
    "When creating an array of objects, you **actually create an array of references**, each reference is initialized to null. You can create an array of primitives, the compiler zeros the memory.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[] myIntArray = new int[3];\n",
    "String[] myStringArray = new String[3];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.4 Scoping\n",
    "Code scope is determined by curly braces. Objects created with **new** stay as long as you want. When no reference is pointing to one object, this object is collected by GC.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.5 Class\n",
    "Each class has two crucial components:\n",
    "1. Data Members\n",
    "2. Methods (Including constructor)\n",

    "The hierarchy of constructor calls brings up an interesting dilemma. What happens if you’re inside a constructor and you call a dynamically-bound method of the object being constructed? Inside an ordinary method you can imagine what will happen – the dynamically-bound call is resolved at run-time because the object cannot know whether it belongs to the class the method is in or some class derived from it. For consistency, you might think this is what should happen inside constructors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not exactly the case. If you call a dynamically-bound method inside a constructor, the overridden definition for that method is used. However, the effect can be rather unexpected, and can conceal some difficult-to-find bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, the constructor’s job is to bring the object into existence (which is hardly an ordinary feat). Inside any constructor, the entire object might be only partially formed – you can know only that the base-class objects have been initialized, but you cannot know which classes are inherited from you. A dynamically-bound method call, however, reaches “forward” or “outward” into the inheritance hierarchy. It calls a method in a derived class. If you do this inside a constructor, you call a method that might manipulate members that haven’t been initialized yet – a sure recipe for disaster.\n",
