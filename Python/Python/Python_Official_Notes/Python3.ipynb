    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language, which can save you considerable time during program development because no compilation and linking is necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "The interpreter can be used interactively, which makes it easy to experiment with features of the language, to write throw-away programs, or to test functions during bottom-up program development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs written in Python are typically much shorter than equivalent C, C++, or Java programs, for several reasons:\n",
    "* the high-level data types allow you to express complex operations in a single statement;\n",
    "* statement grouping is done by indentation instead of beginning and ending brackets;\n",
    "* no variable or argument declarations are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "the language is named after the BBC show “Monty Python’s Flying Circus” and has nothing to do with reptiles."

    "# 2.Using Python Interpreter\n",
    "## 2.1 Invoking the Interpreter \n",
    "Start python interpreter by typing the command:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "python3.6\n",
    "```\n",
    "The interpreter’s line-editing features include interactive editing, history substitution and code completion on systems that support readline.\n",
    "\n",
    "A second way of starting the interpreter is ``python -c command [arg] ...``, which executes the statement(s) in command, analogous to the shell’s -c option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some Python modules are also useful as scripts. These can be invoked using ``python -m module [arg] ...``, which executes the source file for module as if you had spelled out its full name on the command line. -m to allow modules to be located using the Python module namespace for execution as scripts. The motivating examples were standard library modules such as pdb and profile. You can also do ``python module [arg]``, where the py file will only be searched under current directory.\n",
    "### 2.1.1 Argument Passing\n",
    "When known to the interpreter, the script name and additional arguments thereafter are turned into a list of strings and assigned to the ``argv`` variable in the ``sys`` module. You can access this list by executing ``import sys``. The length of the list is at least one; when no script and no arguments are given, ``sys.argv[0]`` is an empty string. When the script name is given as ``'-'`` (meaning standard input), ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to ``'-'``. When ``-c`` command is used, sys.argv[0] is set to ``'-c'``. When -m module is used, ``sys.argv[0]`` is set to the full name of the located module. Options found after -c command or -m module are not consumed by the Python interpreter’s option processing but left in ``sys.argv`` for the command or module to handle.\n",
    "## 2.2The Interpreter and Its Environment\n",
    "### 2.2.1 Source Code Encoding\n",
    "By default, Python source files are treated as encoded in UTF-8. The standard library only uses ASCII characters for identifiers, a convention that any portable code should follow.\n"

    "Python handles integers of arbitrary value, like ``1``, ``100``, ``-8080``, ``0``, etc. One can also use hex representation like ``0xff00``, ``0xa5b3c4d2``, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "To represent float values, one can use ``1.23``, ``3.14``. For floats that are very large or small, one should use scientific representation, like ``1.23e9`` or ``1.2e-5``.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators ``+``, ``-``, ``*`` and ``/`` work just like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses ``()`` can be used for grouping. \n",

    "\n",
    "Division ``/`` always returns a float. To do floor division and get an integer result (discarding any fractional result) you can use the ``// ``operator; to calculate the remainder you can use ``%``.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3.1.2 Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can also manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ``'...'`` or double quotes ``\"...\"`` with the same result. ``\\`` can be used to escape quotes:\n",

    ">>> '\"Isn\\'t,\" she said.'\n",
    "'\"Isn\\'t,\" she said.'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the interactive interpreter, the output string is enclosed in quotes and special characters are escaped with backslashes. The string is enclosed in double quotes if the string contains a single quote and no double quotes, otherwise it is enclosed in single quotes. The ``print()`` function produces a more readable output, by omitting the enclosing quotes and by printing escaped and special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> '\"Isn\\'t,\" she said.'\n",
    "'\"Isn\\'t,\" she said.'\n",
    ">>> print('\"Isn\\'t,\" she said.')\n",
    "\"Isn't,\" she said.\n",

    ">>> s  # without print(), \\n is included in the output\n",
    "'First line.\\nSecond line.'\n",
    ">>> print(s)  # with print(), \\n produces a new line\n",
    "First line.\n",
    "Second line.\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you don’t want characters prefaced by ``\\`` to be interpreted as special characters, you can use raw strings by adding an r before the first quote:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print('C:\\some\\name')  # here \\n means newline!\n",
    "C:\\some\n",
    "ame\n",
    ">>> print(r'C:\\some\\name')  # note the r before the quote\n",
    "C:\\some\\name\n",
    "```\n",
    "String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: ``\"\"\"...\"\"\"`` or ``'''...'''``. End of lines are automatically included in the string, but it’s possible to prevent this by adding a ``\\`` at the end of the line. The following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"\"\"\\\n",
    "Usage: thingy [OPTIONS]\n",
    "     -h                        Display this usage message\n",
    "     -H hostname               Hostname to connect to\n",

    "Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one.

    "```python\n",
    ">>> if x < 0:\n",
    "...     x = 0\n",
    "...     print('Negative changed to zero')\n",

    "\n",
    "The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not the value of the object). When a function calls another function, a new local symbol table is created for that call.\n",

    "A function definition introduces the function name in the current symbol table. The value of the function name has a type that is recognized by the interpreter as a user-defined function.

    "```\n",
    "In a function call, keyword arguments must follow positional arguments. All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function (e.g. ``actor`` is not a valid argument for the ``parrot`` function), and their order is not important. This also includes non-optional arguments (e.g. ``parrot(voltage=1000)`` is valid too). No argument may receive a value more than once.\n",

    "The reverse situation occurs when the arguments are already in a list or tuple but need to be unpacked for a function call requiring separate positional arguments. For instance, the built-in range() function expects separate start and stop arguments.

If two items to be compared are themselves sequences of the same type, the lexicographical comparison is carried out recursively. If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one.
